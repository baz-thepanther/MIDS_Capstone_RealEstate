What changed?
	Removed column "Click Here" for zillow link and made city column clickable to take to zillow site. Less clutter.
	Instead of "Click Here" for price trend made that into a clickable button with thumb-nail image for the price trend.
		Clicking the button brings up a pop-up chart that can be closed by pressing ESC or clicking the close-button.
